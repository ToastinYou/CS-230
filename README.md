SNHU CS-230 Operating Platforms

The Gaming Room would like to broaden their success from their Android app game, Draw It or Lose It, to a web-based client. The game will have an online multiplayer experience with specified teams that work together to complete puzzles within a given time limit. The experience should be similar to their popular Android app, but on a variety of platforms to seek more players. I did well compiling the executive summary, design constraints, and recommendations. I would go back and revise my evaluation after conducting more research regarding each operating platform. The end goal was to provide recommendations for the client based on their needs, and that was accomplished through this journey. This information, especially the UML diagram will be extremely important when it comes time to design the software for the client.
